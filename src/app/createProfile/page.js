//The sign-up page needs the following elements:
//connection with db
//auth() and userId
//a form to collect the user's profile data
//sql query to insert the user's data into the database
//we need to redirect the user to the homepage once they submit the profile form
//A suggestion: you could have a try and catch for your sql query

//currentUser is the current user logged in - you can import this from clerk???? ?
